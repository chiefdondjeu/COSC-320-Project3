# Project: Graphs for Image Segmentation

For this project you will work individually or with a partner to learn about, implement, and document one interesting graph algorithm or data structure that was not covered during the course lecture. You will prepare a full typed report to describe the motivation for the topic, theoretical properties with some justification, and the results of your own implementation.
