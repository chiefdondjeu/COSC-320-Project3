# Project: Graphs for Image Segmentation

***Name: Florent Dondjeu Tschoufack

## Goal
During this project, you will
- be exposed to the breadth of problem domains in graph theory and computer science
- develop the skills needed to research a problem, understand its motivations and potential solutions,
- be exposed to the genesis of a problem and its historical solutions,
- practice communicating complicated material in computer science and applied mathematics.

## Description
For this project you will work individually or with a partner to learn about, implement, and document one interesting graph algorithm or data structure that was not covered during the course lecture. You will prepare a full typed report to describe the motivation for the topic, theoretical properties with some justification, and the results of your own implementation.
